## Chapter 1: You Are Here
<a id="The-Challenges-We-Face"></a>
### The Challenges We Face

>You have two weeks in the summer to take a vacation with two teenage children. How do you plan it?

Option A, which is more of a command‐and‐control decision with one decision maker, presumably in possession of all the relevant facts, making a rational decision.

Option B requires deeper conversations, and an embrace of ambiguity

– and that's the point.

There is no way to put all of these factors into some equation and come up with an optimal answer. Instead, we learn to muddle through to a satisfactory solution.

A complex system is a system in which many independent components (or “agents”) interact with one another.

“the concept of “wicked problems.” These are problems that are difficult or impossible to solve because our information is incomplete or contradictory. What's more, conditions are continuously changing.”
“Because of the interdependencies within the complex systems that give rise to wicked problems, an effort to solve one problem can give rise to others. We can quickly create “unintended consequences.” There is no simple solution to a wicked problem. Proposed solutions are neither wholly right nor completely wrong, and every wicked problem is unique.”
“We know that no single organization or individual can solve a complex problem. Indeed, every solution we develop is temporary – when conditions inevitably change, we will have to adjust.”

<a id="What-Exactly-has-Changed"></a>
### What, Exactly, has Changed ?

“In the middle of the 1800s, that began to change,”
“New machines made it possible to produce things people needed or wanted”
“Companies formed around these new technologies and began to draw people into cities for work to create these new goods. This “industrial revolution”
“But as with most big transitions, there was a trade‐off. These new jobs didn't come with the same freedom to organize one's own days, weeks, and months.”
“There was a supervisor to answer to. And soon, those supervisors were listening to a new kind of expert, a “management consultant” who talked about “efficiencies” and timed each part of a job, finding ways to shave off even hundredths of a second from each component of a task, in order to maximize profits.”
“Each worker had a supervisor, who was also overseen by a supervisor, and there was another supervisor after that. This structure – the hierarchy – came to characterize the world of work”
“organization charts.”

**What Is a Network?**

![Network](./img/network.png?raw=true "Network Structure")
- It forms around a set of assets, or resources. These assets might take many forms: a physical location, a particular technology, even an intangible set of ideas that people hold in common. We often call this set of assets the hub of the network.
- There is usually a set of people who are particularly closely related to the hub. They may be the people who formed the initial network. Communication is easiest within this core, particularly if they are geographically in the same location.
- There are other people who are more loosely connected. They may not even be connected to the hub directly, but rather connected through someone else. It's challenging to get a message to all of these people, particularly those on the periphery.
- The network is never static. There may be people who start off in the core but then become less connected, while there may be other people who become more deeply involved over time. The boundary dividing who is “in” and who is “out” of the network is a porous one.
- There is no “top” or “bottom” to a network. There is no one individual or entity that can give directions for the members to carry out.

**Kinds of Networks**

- advocacy networks  
*made up of people who work to advance a particular cause or idea. Members don't necessarily know each other, but all are part of the network because of its mission.*
- Learning networks  
*group of people wants to increase their knowledge or skills in a particular area. At least some of the members usually know one another reasonably well.*
- innovating network  
*networks are composed of people who have joined forces to create new value together, like the children's story Stone Soup*

**Hierarchies, Networks, and Strategy**

In a hierarchy, the challenge is to communicate information about what to do down, and to get information about the results up.  
In a network, on the other hand, the challenge is to get the members' resources and efforts aligned toward a chosen objective.

<a id="S-Curve"></a>
### S-Curve

![s-curve](./img/s-curve.png?raw=true "The S-Curve")

S‐Curves help us understand what is happening at various points in the cycle – or, to put it more broadly, in any change process.
There are three important insights S‐Curves provide:
- Change is constant and dynamic.
- Nothing lasts forever under its initial momentum.
- Success contains the seeds of its own destruction.

<a id="The-Changes-We-Need-To-Make"></a>
### The Changes We Need To Make

- We need to think differently.
- We need to behave differently.
- We need to “do” differently (this is different than behaving differently).

**Thinking Differently**  

Let's start with a not‐so‐simple question: What is strategy, anyhow?  
Where are we going? and How are we going to get there? With this definition, think about the strategic plans you've recently read or been a part of developing.  
Strategy has to be a team effort, and the more complex the environment, the larger the group – the network – that will need to be engaged.  
The word we often use for working together is *collaboration*.  

*True* collaboration is at one end of a continuum of joint efforts.  
When people come together, they usually start by just exchanging information about who they are and what they do – we often call this *networking*.    
A bit more involved is *coordinating*, Still further along the continuum is *cooperating*.  
All of these activities are good – but they aren't collaboration (although we may claim otherwise in a presentation!).    
Collaboration involves linking, leveraging, and aligning resources in ways that enhance one another's capacity to create a shared outcome, a mutual benefit.  

**Behaving Differently**  

Their work together took four months, and resulted in the US Constitution.  
The key point is that the delegates realized that the work they were embarking upon was exceedingly complex and fraught with tension. In order to navigate the discussions ahead, they recognized before they started that they needed to decide what the ground rules should be.    
In any change effort, there are three kinds of people,  
Since “trust” is another of those words that can mean different things to different people, here's what we mean by trust – not so much a definition as a test for its existence: trust is established when words and actions align.  
At one end, there are pioneers, the people leading the charge and eager to change. This is usually a small group,  
Then there is a much larger group, which we can call the pragmatists.  
Pragmatists will go along with change as soon as they see that it's prudent to do so – they want to see that their time and/or reputation won't be wasted.  
“there's a third group – those that aren't interested in joining in. They say (and keep saying) things like, “That will never work,” “We've tried that before,” or “What we have is good enough.” We call this group the soreheads. Fortunately, their numbers are also few.  
![The people in the network](./img/people-in-network.png?raw=true "The people in the network")  
I know there's one‐third that is ready to move, and if they come along, there's another third that will join in to join the first third. And I don't worry about the last third.  
There are often people who look like soreheads but turn out to be pragmatists – they're just a bit slower to join up.  
we need to behave differently not just when we're discussing what we might do, but when we actually begin to make decisions.  
We need to balance two dimensions: guidance and participation.  
no guidance but lots of people involved, you get chaos.  
no guidance and low participation, that's apathy  
plenty of guidance but low participation – the classic backroom deal.  
high participation with high guidance. Everyone's voice is heard, but the discussion is guided and has direction.  
there has been plenty of input, but it's also efficient – people don't feel that their time has been wasted with meetings that don't go anywhere.  

**Doing Differently**    

“Thinking differently and behaving differently “set the table” for the third thing that needs to happen in order for companies, organizations, or communities to successfully navigate challenges – doing differently.”
“The ten skills in the remainder of this book break that “doing” down into specific components that are simple to understand and put into practice. They are not, however, a “one‐and‐done” formula. Change is constant – there is always another S‐Curve, sooner or later.”
internet & software design  
internet:
- interactive communications: 1-1 emal, 1-n youtube, n-1 kickstarter, n-n ebay  
- break classical top-down hierarchy and the traditional strategic planning  

software design:  
- members of team are each working on just a bit of the program
- meets together frequently so that they can stay on track and aligned with one another and ensure that there aren't any compatibility issues.  
- old time: every version with box, now: patches update 

What is critical is that the team has a process to manage this kind of ongoing effort – ways of working together that have become firmly established with practice and discipline.  

\* \* \*  

We've now set the stage for the ten skills by introducing some of the key concepts that explain why strategy needs to be approached differently and a few of the assumptions you'll glimpse in the pages ahead.  
- When faced with complexity, the right approach is one in which there are a limited number of principles, but ones that are robust enough to allow for many possibilities and strategic shifts where necessary.
- They are simple, but not easy; they require practice and attention to master.  
- The real power of the skills is in combining them – perhaps not all ten at any one time, but identifying the skills most called for in a particular situation. The whole is truly more than the sum of its parts.

## Chapter 2: Create And Maintain A Safe Space For Deep, Focused Conversation (Skill 1)
<a id="Deep-Conversations"></a>  
>Agile leadership means knowing how to guide conversations. This ability begins with understanding how to create and maintain a safe space where great conversations can occur.  
> 
>let's first be sure to understand the nature of deep, focused conversations. That will help us determine the right sort of spaces in which to have them.  

### Deep Conversations
<a id="Focused-Conversations"></a>
Eleanor Roosevelt:  
>Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.  

Of course, not every conversation needs to be a deep one. Many of the daily tasks of business and life can be accomplished with conversations that skim, appropriately, right along the surface.      
ordering a take-out pizza dont need a talk of idea  
the more we discuss ideas with others, the happier and more satisfied we are likely to be.  

### Focused Conversations
<a id="Deep-Focused-Group-Conversations"></a>
Focus is hard to come by.   
Time to focus and time to have focused conversations won't just happen.   
For most of us, life is just too busy.   
>Focus requires discipline

Like deep conversations, focused conversations won't just happen. We need to deliberately shut out potential distractions, even for just a short amount of time.    

### Deep, Focused Group Conversations
<a id="The-Agile-Leader-as-Conversation-Guide"></a>
Increasing the productivity of groups and teams begins with increasing the productivity of their conversations. There are several ways we can address this.  

**Group Size**

One of the ways to assure deep, focused group conversations is to pay attention to the size of the group having the conversation.  

optimal group size:
- Amazon's Jeff Bezos's “two‐pizza
- Decide & Deliver: 7 persons and that every person beyond seven reduced the team's effectiveness by 10%
- Psychological Sciences: 5 persons 

ps. above in common is that five and seven are both odd numbers, having an odd number of people in a group is better than an even number.  

if team size gets to about 15~20 members, all they can do is to make a decision about when to take a lunch break.

**Safe Places for Conversation**

we can now turn our attention to the spaces and places where such conversations can best occur.

we don't always have the ability to determine where and when strategic conversations will happen. Whenever possible, however, it is preferable to give this some thought and to do some preplanning.

We selected a location for the first gathering that was neutral and, as one of our colleagues describes it, *equally inconvenient for everyone involved*

In communities, it is especially important to pay attention to the local context when deciding where to have strategic conversations.
- the library is often a safe space for strategic conversations about civic issues. A library has some basic rules of behavior, and usually there's no such thing as a dumb question at the library.
- children's museums. It could be something called the teddy bear principle at work: there is evidence that when adults are exposed to childhood cues they exhibit more prosocial behavior.

**Safe Spaces for Conversation**

Along with safe physical places, the notion of safe behavior is equally important

*psychological* safety: Edmondson describes it as a shared belief among members of a team or group that they are safe in taking interpersonal risks. In psychologically safe teams, team members feel accepted and respected.

As a leader, how do you assure psychological safety in creating and maintaining safe spaces for deep focused conversations?

A Brilliant Solution: Inventing the American Constitution, a such complex conversations, the first order of business was to draft the rules that would govern their conversations, like:
- while a member is speaking don't walk in front, hold sidebar conversations, or read a newspaper or pamphlet
- if two men rise to speak at the time, General Washington will determine the order in which they will speak. Knowing that there were a lot of talkers among the group (apparently an occupational hazard for politicians in every era!)
- on any given topic, a person could only speak two times. These rules helped ensure that the participants felt the kind of psychological safety they needed to confront difficult decisions.

Agile leaders consider the settings of their conversations from many vantage points. The physical location is important, but there are many other factors that will help participants build trust with one another and give their very best to the challenge at hand. When the topic of discussion is complex, the conversation will need to be deep and focused, and such conversations rarely happen without thoughtful planning.

like the travel guider, this is the role of the conversation guide as well, and why this skill of maintaining a safe environment for deep and focused conversation comes first.


### Putting The Skill to Work: The Agile Leader As <u>Conversation Guide</u>
<a id="Skill-2"></a>
Picking the right room, group is the right size, and "dont read a newspaper or pamphlet" likes "put your smartphone away, close your laptop"

Go‐to rule of civility is this – *we will behave in ways that build trust and mutual respect.*

It is not only the role of the agile leader to communicate and reinforce this rule, it is a shared responsibility among those having the conversation

*equity of voice*

there is evidence that the best outcomes occur in groups that have the greatest levels of “equity of voice.

every member talks about the same amount of time.

## Chapter 3: Frame The Conversation With The Right Question (Skill 2)
<a id="One-Question-Many-Answers"></a>
Questions can be powerful

Using the right question to do so can both open up new opportunities and keep the conversation focused in a productive direction.

When the problem definition, solution, and implementation is clear, Heifetz calls this a <u>technical question</u>  

Typically, there is one solution to a technical question.

with technical problems, leaders will engage a skilled person or team to find a solution *using their technical skills.*

<u>>Adaptive questions</u> are different. They point us to challenges for which there are no clear answers.

Adaptive questions can trigger many answers that might all lead to acceptable solutions.

These types of questions have no known procedures or outcomes; they require a deeper questioning of fundamental assumptions and values.

Solving adaptive questions requires us to exert significantly more effort, have a tolerance for uncertainty, and include the presence of divergent voices.

We will need to engage others, and through their collective intelligence and strategic intuition.

The adaptive leader develops the skill of asking clear, adaptive questions.

These questions point a team, organization or community in a new direction. Being an adaptive leader requires you to be open to experimentation and innovation in order to generate answers to your adaptive questions.

You will find that your experiments – your efforts to answer your adaptive question – are iterative.

Exploring these potential solutions allows you to build new levels of trust and collaboration among the people who are part of the journey to discover new answers to adaptive questions.
