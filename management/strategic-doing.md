## Chapter 1: You Are Here
<a id="The-Challenges-We-Face"></a>
### The Challenges We Face

>You have two weeks in the summer to take a vacation with two teenage children. How do you plan it?

Option A, which is more of a command‐and‐control decision with one decision maker, presumably in possession of all the relevant facts, making a rational decision.

Option B requires deeper conversations, and an embrace of ambiguity

– and that's the point.

There is no way to put all of these factors into some equation and come up with an optimal answer. Instead, we learn to muddle through to a satisfactory solution.

A complex system is a system in which many independent components (or "agents”) interact with one another.

"the concept of "wicked problems.” These are problems that are difficult or impossible to solve because our information is incomplete or contradictory. What's more, conditions are continuously changing.”
"Because of the interdependencies within the complex systems that give rise to wicked problems, an effort to solve one problem can give rise to others. We can quickly create "unintended consequences.” There is no simple solution to a wicked problem. Proposed solutions are neither wholly right nor completely wrong, and every wicked problem is unique.”
"We know that no single organization or individual can solve a complex problem. Indeed, every solution we develop is temporary – when conditions inevitably change, we will have to adjust.”

<a id="What-Exactly-has-Changed"></a>
### What, Exactly, has Changed ?

"In the middle of the 1800s, that began to change,”
"New machines made it possible to produce things people needed or wanted”
"Companies formed around these new technologies and began to draw people into cities for work to create these new goods. This "industrial revolution”
"But as with most big transitions, there was a trade‐off. These new jobs didn't come with the same freedom to organize one's own days, weeks, and months.”
"There was a supervisor to answer to. And soon, those supervisors were listening to a new kind of expert, a "management consultant” who talked about "efficiencies” and timed each part of a job, finding ways to shave off even hundredths of a second from each component of a task, in order to maximize profits.”
"Each worker had a supervisor, who was also overseen by a supervisor, and there was another supervisor after that. This structure – the hierarchy – came to characterize the world of work”
"organization charts.”

**What Is a Network?**

![Network](./img/network.png?raw=true "Network Structure")
- It forms around a set of assets, or resources. These assets might take many forms: a physical location, a particular technology, even an intangible set of ideas that people hold in common. We often call this set of assets the hub of the network.
- There is usually a set of people who are particularly closely related to the hub. They may be the people who formed the initial network. Communication is easiest within this core, particularly if they are geographically in the same location.
- There are other people who are more loosely connected. They may not even be connected to the hub directly, but rather connected through someone else. It's challenging to get a message to all of these people, particularly those on the periphery.
- The network is never static. There may be people who start off in the core but then become less connected, while there may be other people who become more deeply involved over time. The boundary dividing who is "in” and who is "out” of the network is a porous one.
- There is no "top” or "bottom” to a network. There is no one individual or entity that can give directions for the members to carry out.

**Kinds of Networks**

- advocacy networks  
*made up of people who work to advance a particular cause or idea. Members don't necessarily know each other, but all are part of the network because of its mission.*
- Learning networks  
*group of people wants to increase their knowledge or skills in a particular area. At least some of the members usually know one another reasonably well.*
- innovating network  
*networks are composed of people who have joined forces to create new value together, like the children's story Stone Soup*

**Hierarchies, Networks, and Strategy**

In a hierarchy, the challenge is to communicate information about what to do down, and to get information about the results up.  
In a network, on the other hand, the challenge is to get the members' resources and efforts aligned toward a chosen objective.

<a id="S-Curve"></a>
### S-Curve

![s-curve](./img/s-curve.png?raw=true "The S-Curve")

S‐Curves help us understand what is happening at various points in the cycle – or, to put it more broadly, in any change process.
There are three important insights S‐Curves provide:
- Change is constant and dynamic.
- Nothing lasts forever under its initial momentum.
- Success contains the seeds of its own destruction.

<a id="The-Changes-We-Need-To-Make"></a>
### The Changes We Need To Make

- We need to think differently.
- We need to behave differently.
- We need to "do” differently (this is different than behaving differently).

**Thinking Differently**  

Let's start with a not‐so‐simple question: What is strategy, anyhow?  
Where are we going? and How are we going to get there? With this definition, think about the strategic plans you've recently read or been a part of developing.  
Strategy has to be a team effort, and the more complex the environment, the larger the group – the network – that will need to be engaged.  
The word we often use for working together is *collaboration*.  

*True* collaboration is at one end of a continuum of joint efforts.  
When people come together, they usually start by just exchanging information about who they are and what they do – we often call this *networking*.    
A bit more involved is *coordinating*, Still further along the continuum is *cooperating*.  
All of these activities are good – but they aren't collaboration (although we may claim otherwise in a presentation!).    
Collaboration involves linking, leveraging, and aligning resources in ways that enhance one another's capacity to create a shared outcome, a mutual benefit.  

**Behaving Differently**  

Their work together took four months, and resulted in the US Constitution.  
The key point is that the delegates realized that the work they were embarking upon was exceedingly complex and fraught with tension. In order to navigate the discussions ahead, they recognized before they started that they needed to decide what the ground rules should be.    
In any change effort, there are three kinds of people,  
Since "trust” is another of those words that can mean different things to different people, here's what we mean by trust – not so much a definition as a test for its existence: trust is established when words and actions align.  
At one end, there are pioneers, the people leading the charge and eager to change. This is usually a small group,  
Then there is a much larger group, which we can call the pragmatists.  
Pragmatists will go along with change as soon as they see that it's prudent to do so – they want to see that their time and/or reputation won't be wasted.  
"there's a third group – those that aren't interested in joining in. They say (and keep saying) things like, "That will never work,” "We've tried that before,” or "What we have is good enough.” We call this group the soreheads. Fortunately, their numbers are also few.  
![The people in the network](./img/people-in-network.png?raw=true "The people in the network")  
I know there's one‐third that is ready to move, and if they come along, there's another third that will join in to join the first third. And I don't worry about the last third.  
There are often people who look like soreheads but turn out to be pragmatists – they're just a bit slower to join up.  
we need to behave differently not just when we're discussing what we might do, but when we actually begin to make decisions.  
We need to balance two dimensions: guidance and participation.  
no guidance but lots of people involved, you get chaos.  
no guidance and low participation, that's apathy  
plenty of guidance but low participation – the classic backroom deal.  
high participation with high guidance. Everyone's voice is heard, but the discussion is guided and has direction.  
there has been plenty of input, but it's also efficient – people don't feel that their time has been wasted with meetings that don't go anywhere.  

**Doing Differently**    

"Thinking differently and behaving differently "set the table” for the third thing that needs to happen in order for companies, organizations, or communities to successfully navigate challenges – doing differently.”
"The ten skills in the remainder of this book break that "doing” down into specific components that are simple to understand and put into practice. They are not, however, a "one‐and‐done” formula. Change is constant – there is always another S‐Curve, sooner or later.”
internet & software design  
internet:
- interactive communications: 1-1 emal, 1-n youtube, n-1 kickstarter, n-n ebay  
- break classical top-down hierarchy and the traditional strategic planning  

software design:  
- members of team are each working on just a bit of the program
- meets together frequently so that they can stay on track and aligned with one another and ensure that there aren't any compatibility issues.  
- old time: every version with box, now: patches update 

What is critical is that the team has a process to manage this kind of ongoing effort – ways of working together that have become firmly established with practice and discipline.  

\* \* \*  

We've now set the stage for the ten skills by introducing some of the key concepts that explain why strategy needs to be approached differently and a few of the assumptions you'll glimpse in the pages ahead.  
- When faced with complexity, the right approach is one in which there are a limited number of principles, but ones that are robust enough to allow for many possibilities and strategic shifts where necessary.
- They are simple, but not easy; they require practice and attention to master.  
- The real power of the skills is in combining them – perhaps not all ten at any one time, but identifying the skills most called for in a particular situation. The whole is truly more than the sum of its parts.

## Chapter 2: Create And Maintain A Safe Space For Deep, Focused Conversation (Skill 1)
<a id="Deep-Conversations"></a>  
>Agile leadership means knowing how to guide conversations. This ability begins with understanding how to create and maintain a safe space where great conversations can occur.  
> 
>let's first be sure to understand the nature of deep, focused conversations. That will help us determine the right sort of spaces in which to have them.  

### Deep Conversations
<a id="Focused-Conversations"></a>
Eleanor Roosevelt:  
>Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.  

Of course, not every conversation needs to be a deep one. Many of the daily tasks of business and life can be accomplished with conversations that skim, appropriately, right along the surface.      
ordering a take-out pizza dont need a talk of idea  
the more we discuss ideas with others, the happier and more satisfied we are likely to be.  

### Focused Conversations
<a id="Deep-Focused-Group-Conversations"></a>
Focus is hard to come by.   
Time to focus and time to have focused conversations won't just happen.   
For most of us, life is just too busy.   
>Focus requires discipline

Like deep conversations, focused conversations won't just happen. We need to deliberately shut out potential distractions, even for just a short amount of time.    

### Deep, Focused Group Conversations
<a id="The-Agile-Leader-as-Conversation-Guide"></a>
Increasing the productivity of groups and teams begins with increasing the productivity of their conversations. There are several ways we can address this.  

**Group Size**

One of the ways to assure deep, focused group conversations is to pay attention to the size of the group having the conversation.  

optimal group size:
- Amazon's Jeff Bezos's "two‐pizza
- Decide & Deliver: 7 persons and that every person beyond seven reduced the team's effectiveness by 10%
- Psychological Sciences: 5 persons 

ps. above in common is that five and seven are both odd numbers, having an odd number of people in a group is better than an even number.  

if team size gets to about 15~20 members, all they can do is to make a decision about when to take a lunch break.

**Safe Places for Conversation**

we can now turn our attention to the spaces and places where such conversations can best occur.

we don't always have the ability to determine where and when strategic conversations will happen. Whenever possible, however, it is preferable to give this some thought and to do some preplanning.

We selected a location for the first gathering that was neutral and, as one of our colleagues describes it, *equally inconvenient for everyone involved*

In communities, it is especially important to pay attention to the local context when deciding where to have strategic conversations.
- the library is often a safe space for strategic conversations about civic issues. A library has some basic rules of behavior, and usually there's no such thing as a dumb question at the library.
- children's museums. It could be something called the teddy bear principle at work: there is evidence that when adults are exposed to childhood cues they exhibit more prosocial behavior.

**Safe Spaces for Conversation**

Along with safe physical places, the notion of safe behavior is equally important

*psychological* safety: Edmondson describes it as a shared belief among members of a team or group that they are safe in taking interpersonal risks. In psychologically safe teams, team members feel accepted and respected.

As a leader, how do you assure psychological safety in creating and maintaining safe spaces for deep focused conversations?

A Brilliant Solution: Inventing the American Constitution, a such complex conversations, the first order of business was to draft the rules that would govern their conversations, like:
- while a member is speaking don't walk in front, hold sidebar conversations, or read a newspaper or pamphlet
- if two men rise to speak at the time, General Washington will determine the order in which they will speak. Knowing that there were a lot of talkers among the group (apparently an occupational hazard for politicians in every era!)
- on any given topic, a person could only speak two times. These rules helped ensure that the participants felt the kind of psychological safety they needed to confront difficult decisions.

Agile leaders consider the settings of their conversations from many vantage points. The physical location is important, but there are many other factors that will help participants build trust with one another and give their very best to the challenge at hand. When the topic of discussion is complex, the conversation will need to be deep and focused, and such conversations rarely happen without thoughtful planning.

like the travel guider, this is the role of the conversation guide as well, and why this skill of maintaining a safe environment for deep and focused conversation comes first.


### Putting The Skill to Work: The Agile Leader As <u>Conversation Guide</u>
<a id="Skill-2"></a>
Picking the right room, group is the right size, and "dont read a newspaper or pamphlet" likes "put your smartphone away, close your laptop"

Go‐to rule of civility is this – *we will behave in ways that build trust and mutual respect.*

It is not only the role of the agile leader to communicate and reinforce this rule, it is a shared responsibility among those having the conversation

*equity of voice*

there is evidence that the best outcomes occur in groups that have the greatest levels of "equity of voice.

every member talks about the same amount of time.

## Chapter 3: Frame The Conversation With The Right Question (Skill 2)
<a id="One-Question-Many-Answers"></a>
Questions can be powerful

Using the right question to do so can both open up new opportunities and keep the conversation focused in a productive direction.

### Adaptive Leadership: One Question, Many Answers
<a id="Appreciative-Questions"></a>
When the problem definition, solution, and implementation is clear, Heifetz calls this a <u>technical question</u>

Typically, there is one solution to a technical question.

with technical problems, leaders will engage a skilled person or team to find a solution *using their technical skills.*

<u>>Adaptive questions</u> are different. They point us to challenges for which there are no clear answers.

Adaptive questions can trigger many answers that might all lead to acceptable solutions.

These types of questions have no known procedures or outcomes; they require a deeper questioning of fundamental assumptions and values.

Solving adaptive questions requires us to exert significantly more effort, have a tolerance for uncertainty, and include the presence of divergent voices.

We will need to engage others, and through their collective intelligence and strategic intuition.

The adaptive leader develops the skill of asking clear, adaptive questions.

These questions point a team, organization or community in a new direction. Being an adaptive leader requires you to be open to experimentation and innovation in order to generate answers to your adaptive questions.

You will find that your experiments – your efforts to answer your adaptive question – are iterative.

Exploring these potential solutions allows you to build new levels of trust and collaboration among the people who are part of the journey to discover new answers to adaptive questions.

We have found that the most productive way to address wicked problems begins by attracting diverse voices with a powerful *framing question.*

Good framing questions are adaptive questions.

They grab the listener who wants to know more about how it will be accomplished and how they can be part of the solution. A good framing question is an invitation to deeper conversation that will lead to more questions, experimentation, and, ultimately, innovation.

**5+5 = x** and **a+b = 10**

x should be 10, and a, b have an infinite number of possible answers.

how we ask questions opens us to new possibilities. Our two questions differ only in the way they are framed.

### Appreciative Questions
<a id="Developing-Questions-To-Frame-Conversations"></a>
We need to be intentional in how we design and guide these conversations, because our actions will follow them.

People move in the direction of their conversations – both for good and for ill.

You can probably recognize this phenomenon from your own experience: you start out with an adaptive challenge – a wicked problem, perhaps – and you immediately begin diving into analyzing the cause of the problem. It can be a never‐ending task, because, by definition, there is no single cause of a wicked problem. There is no single answer to an adaptive challenge.

Here's the important point: when we face an adaptive challenge – or a wicked problem – we should not engage in a problem‐centric conversation. If we do, we are heading into an endless loop where nothing happens.

Cognitive psychology supports this idea that our conversations shape our actions

An individual's emotions and behavior follow the pattern of thought – the mental models – that we carry around in our heads. If our mental model interprets every situation as a problem to be solved, our conversation and behavior will be problem‐focused.

If we focus on *opportunities*, we make sure that we do not fall into the ever‐deepening chasm of problem analysis.

we need to realize at the outset that we will never completely understand the causes of these kinds of wicked problems.

We need to know enough – enough to engage in the conversation, and trust that we will learn more as we work together.

In meeting adaptive challenges, we learn by doing. So, we need conversations that lead us to action, to experimentation, so we can generate new insights into these complex situations.

Choosing the right question makes an enormous difference.

We become paralyzed by the mistaken belief that there is one problem to solve

Truly complex problems will require that people are committed for the long haul. We need their engagement and insights.

### Developing Questions To Frame Conversations
<a id="The-Agile-Leader-As-Questioner"></a>
you can use a question to frame a conversation so that the people you assemble are working together in new ways.

Through a deeper conversation, you can move toward practical ways to address wicked problems.

Appreciative framing questions open the door to new solutions to adaptive challenges.

Developing a powerful framing question is not easy. For many of us, this change in thinking requires practice.

You may find in your journey that people start by asking, "How can we do this?” or "How should we do that?”

These questions may sound like they are opportunity‐focused.

Don't be deceived – as soon as you start using words like can and should, you're implying judgment and shutting off possibilities: Can we really do it? And should we?

You can avoid this trap by substituting the word might: "How might we…” In this way, you're able to defer judgment,

Help people to create options more freely, and open more possibilities.

*What can we to do minimize customer anger and complaints?* This is an example of a nonappreciative question.

*When have customers been most pleased with our service and what might we learn and apply from those moments of success?* The overall focus of the inquiry is on what the organization wants more of, not less.

The right framing question is enough to completely transform a conversation and to reboot a group that has gotten stuck. It leads us away from nonproductive mental models and sets the stage for transformation.

When you frame the right question, you can lead others (and yourself) to discover how shared value can be created together.

With the right framing question, participants will be eager to contribute their expertise and share other resources as they respond.

### Putting The Skill to Work: The Agile Leader As <u>Questioner</u>
<a id="Skill-3"></a>
Ask good questions is to practice "How might” questions.

like "How might I improve this situation?”

You can also practice your skills at asking better questions by selecting a topic and writing down as many questions as you can in a few minutes.

Then look at your list. Sort them by technical versus adaptive questions.

Now write a second list of questions. See if you have improved the questions with each round that you do.

Asking yourself – regularly – if your questions inspire others to contribute their time, ideas and energy.

- Great questions are surprising. They are questions that people haven't discussed or thought about before.
- They are questions that cause people to reflect and think.
- They touch people's heart and spirit. They are questions that are personally meaningful and touch on that most matters to them.
- They prompt stories that will build relationships. As a result of the conversations these questions engender, people feel closer to each other. A greater sense of vulnerability and trust is achieved.
- They force us to look at reality a little differently. Sometimes reality can be reframed by the way a question is asked.

## Chapter 4: Identify Your Assets, Including The Hidden Ones(Skill 3)
<a id="Assets"></a>
Many people operate in what we might call "If Only Land.”

Every time they are part of a conversation, they are quick to bring up what they wish they had

* *If only we hadn't missed that opportunity…*  
* *If only we had more money…*
* *If only other countries didn't have such low labor costs…*

the people and organization truly would like to be in a different position.

But at the end of the conversation, nothing's changed, and most likely, the next time you talk, you'll hear the same sentiments over again.

We've convinced ourselves that we can't really do anything until someone else acts to fill a need that we see as critical.

It's not necessarily that we are pessimistic by nature (although that may be the case for some of us).

It's really a manifestation of hierarchy thinking.

In network thinking, there is no top or bottom. We may still need resources, but there is no one whose job it is to give them to us.

In a network environment, it is exceptionally practical. We have resources all around us that can be used in new and different ways.

### Assets
<a id="Guidelines-For-Identifying-Assets"></a>
* *Physical and natural assets*
* *Skill and knowledge assets*
* *Social assets* : Personally acquainted
* *Capital assets* : While we don't want to limit our thinking to money, we certainly can't forget about it either. Capital assets are financial resources or assets that otherwise would be bought

As you think about what assets you or your group have, you might not be sure what category they belong in. That's okay – the categories are primarily meant to help you expand your thinking about the assets you have at your disposal

Focusing on what we do have – our assets – helps us change our focus to the opportunities that lie before us. It is an appreciative approach.

The skill of identifying assets keeps us focused on talking about opportunities, not problems.

### Guidelines For Identifying Assets
<a id="Hidden-Assets"></a>
First, *direct influence* is critical. If it's not your asset, it's (to be blunt) not an asset

Assets have to be either resources you personally own, or that you at least exert significant control over

Second, each person makes *autonomous decisions* about sharing assets. Sometimes a member just doesn't want to make an asset available for whatever reason, they are decisions that need to be respected.

Finally, true assets are *actionable*

### Hidden Assets
<a id="Assets-Are-Starting-Points"></a>
Everyone has assets, and often the most valuable assets are the ones that no one thought of at first

### Assets Are Starting Points
<a id="The-Agile-Leader-As-Inventory-Taker"></a>
*Bring a brick, not a cathedral*

they don't have to finish the whole "story."

in fact, it's usually better when we *don't* have a complete idea in mind. We start from an open‐minded posture, in which each person can say, "This is what I have – a few bricks.”

However, the flip side of this disadvantage is a powerful truth: because you are only working with what you have, you can start work *right now*.

### Putting The Skill to Work: The Agile Leader As <u>Inventory Taker</u>
<a id="Skill-4"></a>
Each of the people in your group will bring their own set of assets. Sometimes they are assets that are really truly their own, and sometimes they are assets that they can exert control over

If you know each other well, you can prod a bit to remind one another of assets they might have left out

However, remember that members of your group have autonomy – they can decide whether to make the asset available to others

Every cautious pragmatist that comes on board may decide that they do, in fact, trust the group enough to cash in on that favor someone owes them.

Keep asking yourself (and others) what new assets you have that you might be willing to share. The assets you have to work with will grow as you work.

Agile leaders help surface potential that the group didn't know existed by focusing on assets. They focus a network on what can be done, rather than wallowing in its problems or waiting for someone else to act.

Even when the resources seem inadequate, knowing what they are means that the group can start building with those bricks, thinking creatively about using them to create new opportunities.

## Chapter 5: Link And Leverage Assets To Identify New Opportunities (Skill 4)
<a id="Linking-And-Leveraging-Assets-To-Innovate"></a>
Agile leaders not only uncover hidden assets, they also see how different assets could be linked, leveraged, and aligned, and can help others see that potential as well.

### Linking And Leveraging Assets To Innovate
<a id="Linking-And-Leveraging-Assets-Force-Us-To-Think-Horizontally"></a>
Linking and leveraging assets can help us be more innovative. Here's an example of linking and leveraging assets in action:

The owner called the salad The Aviator in honor of the many Navy airmen who made their way over the border from San Diego to eat at the establishment: Caesar Cardini's Tijuana restaurant. It would be a few years before it became known as the Caesar Salad, invented on July 4, 1924.

taking things that already exist and combining them in new ways

This is also what we mean when we talk about linking and leveraging assets

The assets didn't align themselves automatically.

Sometimes these breakthroughs happen serendipitously, or seemingly so, but you can follow a discipline to help structure that serendipitously. *The right framing question*
Our opportunities to link, leverage, and align assets are literally endless

### Linking And Leveraging Assets Force Us To Think Horizontally
<a id="Developing-Your-Ability-To-Think-Horizontally"></a>
Vertical thinking is useful when we need to reflect deeply about things. It is also, however, helpful to think horizontally, across different disciplines, fields, or bodies of knowledge.

New insights can occur when we think horizontally

An agile leader develops the skills to do each of these things: to see assets in different domains and spot their intersections and or connection possibilities, as well as to bring people together to reveal their hidden assets and then spot the link‐and‐leverage opportunities

### Developing Your Ability To Think Horizontally
<a id="Guiding-A-Group-To-Think-Horizontally"></a>
If you are not someone for whom thinking horizontally comes naturally, there is good news. This is a skill that can be learned. Imagine you are working on a real "head‐scratcher,” trying to solve a particularly perplexing problem. This is a good time to take a *"thought walk"*

On a walk outside, you possibly encounter sounds of birds chirping, the daffodils that are starting to bloom, a discarded water bottle, or just about anything else. On an errand it could be the items you pick up at the store

Don't look for things that are related to the problem or idea you are working on, rather, select items with no apparent connection to your problem or idea and no apparent relationship to one another

When you return from your thought walk jot down the characteristics of the items you encountered or acquired. For that tape dispenser, you might write down words like sticky, transparent, spinning. Now try to find a connection between one or more of the characteristics and the problem or idea you are working on

### Guiding A Group To Think Horizontally
<a id="The-Agile-Leader-As-Connector"></a>
A person's mind and cognitive processing are not limited to their head or even their body. The extended mind extends into the person's world, including to objects

*"What we might call "assets” are thus everywhere”*

Solutions to today's complex challenges will not be developed in hierarchies. They will be designed in networks that link and leverage assets

### Putting The Skill to Work: The Agile Leader As <u>Connector</u>
<a id="Skill-5"></a>
The natural horizontal thinkers take to it quickly – but it's also a skill that can be strengthened through practice

To begin, you could start with identifying a small set of assets – perhaps a few assets in each of the categories from the last chapter. Select three to four at random and see if you can come up with a way in which they could be combined – a hypothetical new product, service, program, or initiative that might have some value. Suspend your evaluative instincts and go for quantity over quality

## Chapter 6: Look For The "Big Easy" (Skill 5)
<a id="Decision-Making-Methodologies"></a>
*"Our days are full of choices. Decisions”*

Individual choices are up to each of us, but especially when we are part of a group and must make a choice, we look for ways that will be are fair to all involved and will meet the goals that the group has set for itself

Assets can be combined to create a limitless set of opportunities, for all practical purposes. This is good news, but we can't do everything at once. To develop and implement an effective strategy, we must move at least one of our ideas to action. The reason is simple: our resources are limited

Often teams can get stuck at this point by ruminating about choices and what should come first

An agile leader needs involves efficiently sorting through many options to identify one that has the best chance of success

### Decision-Making Methodologies
<a id="The-2x2-Matrix"></a>
*You've probably used many different methods to deal with this challenge*

The first is *consensus*, in which everyone agrees to support a particular decision

The selected option may not be the favorite of each person but is the one the group as a whole will support

*Consensus can be hard to achieve*

You may have one vocal individual who insists on their choice, while everyone else has coalesced around a different choice

This alternative is called *consensus minus one*. Everyone must agree, except one person. If that one person cannot convince another, *we move ahead*

But if at least two people do not agree with the majority, the group cannot yet move forward. The assumption behind this method is that if two people oppose a choice, there's probably some good reason. More conversation needs to take place.

Alternatively, you could vote, this has the advantage of being straightforward. However, if the vote is close, you run the risk of continually being dragged back into a discussion about whether the choice was *really* the right one

Majority choice voting has a significant shortcoming: each person is (generally) using one criterion to make their choice

They're thinking to themselves things like:

* *That one would be quick.*
* *This wouldn't cost very much; let's choose it.*
* *That idea would be the most popular with our customers.*

This shortcoming hides two deeper problems:

- first, there's been no discussion about what the criterion is or should be.
- The second is that if the challenge is really an adaptive one, thinking about things in light of only one factor is probably too simplistic

Some groups recognize this problem, and set up a very elaborate rating system in which every idea is evaluated using several criteria. Then all the ratings are totaled, sometimes weighted so that one or more criteria count more than others, and a "winner” is announced

This seems scientific enough, but in our experience, it's more trouble than it's worth. It can take the rest of the meeting, or even longer, just to set up the rating system

All of these approaches to decision‐making have merit in particular circumstances. In choosing one of these, you are ensuring that decisions are made in a fair and transparent way – that is, there are no "backroom deals."

Think back on a time when your enthusiasm for a project lagged and you may discover that the root cause was a lack of trust in the fairness of the process.

People may not initially support a chosen idea, but if the process is fair their support can be earned.

*This fairness rule in selecting between options is key to the speed and success of implementation.*

When working with a group of people, especially when they do not report to each other but want to accomplish a difficult task together, building an open and fair process takes time and careful consideration of each person's views.

The worst situation occurs when a team takes pains to make a careful decision, and their recommendations are seemingly ignored

Trust has to be high. It takes time to build trust, and it pays dividends to be very careful in the beginning

if you want your organization to be fast and agile, *go slowly at first*. This is even more important for complex challenges in which there is a high level of ambiguity.

### The 2x2 Matrix
<a id="Dealing-With-Doubts-and-Doubters"></a>
The matrix preserves the fair and transparent advantage of the other methods discussed earlier. It also allows you to consider two criteria at the same time.

Example: the decision to be made is where to locate a new school

The school board has identified three possible sites (A, B, and C). The criteria are the cost of construction (the sites are on different kinds of terrain) and the level of activity that would surround the new school (some are in neighborhoods, others are in more congested areas of the city; all things being equal, the board would like to site the school in a quieter area). Each of the five members of the school board makes their own evaluation of those factors and chooses a spot on the matrix for each location (so, there are 5 × 3 = 15 dots on the matrix). It wasn't obvious to the board what the right choice would be since there wasn't one site that was clearly both the quietest and the cheapest, but the matrix helps them visualize that there is, in fact, one choice that is probably optimal – Site B.

![A 2x2 Matrix](./img/2x2-matrix.png?raw=true "A 2x2 Matrix")

Having to consider two criteria at the same time forces people to see “both/and” potential, rather than “either/or.” You naturally ask, “what if,” to generate alternative views. It is a flexible and potent tool.

**Using the Matrix**

To use this tool, there is a very important decision to make: Which two criteria should be considered are best‐suited to your challenge？ but we suggest two in particular: impact and ease of implementation (that's why we call it the Big Easy). You are looking for the opportunity that has the largest ***impact*** and is the ***easiest*** to implement.

Selecting a first opportunity is critical to building the bonds of trust needed to move to the larger projects that will be needed for addressing complex challenges. You want people to be excited about what they are doing, and early success will keep them engaged for the long haul, drawing others in so that bigger opportunities are more achievable.

As people build success by translating ideas into action, they are also building trust. As they are building trust, they are building the capacity to do more and more complex work together. Focusing on the Big Easy provides the right balance of a place to start.

The “Big” in the Big Easy inspires people and engages them emotionally. The “Easy” means that there are practical steps that can be taken now to move toward this opportunity.

Taken together, these two dimensions ensure that the group has avoided two common risks:
* Selecting an idea that is very difficult to do and becoming discouraged, or 
* Selecting something that is easy but inconsequential that no one will really care about.

If you're just starting out, you probably have mostly pioneers around the table. The pragmatists are, for the most part, hanging back to see whether this effort will have staying power and if they can trust the group to treat them and their time well. If you pick an opportunity that is too ambitious and lose steam, you'll never get the pragmatists to join you.

In some instances, a team's members may already know each other well. However, poor habits may have deflated the team. Perhaps they keep meeting with no decisions and no progress. Perhaps everyone has their own project in mind.

The 2×2 matrix can help teams break through old habits and show their opportunities in a new light. It can rejuvenate a team around the potential for change and inspire others to join.

### Dealing With Doubts and Doubters
<a id="The-Agile-Leader-As-Prioritizer"></a>
When there is a complicated choice to be made, one individual may or may not know exactly how much impact an idea will have, or how easy it will be to pull it off.

However, if a group of reasonably well‐informed people all make individual judgments about the two dimensions of impact and ease, the combined weight of all of those judgments will lead the group in the right direction. In our experience, by using a 2×2 matrix to surface a shared strategic intuition, teams gain insights faster, learn faster, and act faster.

But what if you encounter doubters? Structuring your next steps in the same way that software developers do – taking baby steps to “try out” the Big Easy – is one way to respond to that worry. If the first steps toward your Big Easy opportunity prove that it was a dud, the group can easily go back and focus on another opportunity. This “tryout period” is an important advantage of agile strategy over traditional strategic planning

With agile strategy, a limited amount of time will be “wasted” should the team be heading down what turns out to be a wrong path. Even if the group chooses the wrong opportunity to start, they will likely learn a lot from failure.

Facing hard facts together also builds trust. In this way, agile strategy enables you to manage risk in a way that traditional strategic planning never can.

Another common hesitation about using the Big Easy method is that it might appear to be premature to make any decision at all.

That is, some members of the group may feel they need more information. But there is a real risk of delaying a decision on which opportunity to pursue. The group can become fixated on infinite fine tuning, ranking and reranking. Looking for more data can simply delay moving ideas into action. Because we are confronting complex, adaptive challenges, we must accept four realities.
* First, delay – too much talk without action – erodes trust. If getting more information is simply an excuse for not doing anything, the trust in your group will begin to evaporate.
* Second, it is impossible to have enough information to analyze a complex challenge completely before we begin.
* Third, we will only really learn about this complex challenge when we begin to do something together. We need to experiment and test our ideas.
* Fourth, you can be continuously both “generating” and “consuming” data by asking questions as you move forward. As you explore for answers, you will look for more data to guide you.

Finally, you may find that what you chose as the Big Easy does not fit a progression that is in your (or someone else's) head for how the overall opportunity should come together.

What should come first? If the assets are in place to launch the Big Easy we recommend you move forward and not worry about the order. Given enthusiasm and desire for success, the team will find that once the first opportunity is accomplished, they can then move to the next opportunity and the order will address itself.
