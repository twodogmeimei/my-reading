## Chapter 1: You Are Here
<a id="The-Challenges-We-Face"></a>
### The Challenges We Face

>You have two weeks in the summer to take a vacation with two teenage children. How do you plan it?

Option A, which is more of a command‐and‐control decision with one decision maker, presumably in possession of all the relevant facts, making a rational decision.

Option B requires deeper conversations, and an embrace of ambiguity

– and that's the point.

There is no way to put all of these factors into some equation and come up with an optimal answer. Instead, we learn to muddle through to a satisfactory solution.

A complex system is a system in which many independent components (or “agents”) interact with one another.

“the concept of “wicked problems.” These are problems that are difficult or impossible to solve because our information is incomplete or contradictory. What's more, conditions are continuously changing.”
“Because of the interdependencies within the complex systems that give rise to wicked problems, an effort to solve one problem can give rise to others. We can quickly create “unintended consequences.” There is no simple solution to a wicked problem. Proposed solutions are neither wholly right nor completely wrong, and every wicked problem is unique.”
“We know that no single organization or individual can solve a complex problem. Indeed, every solution we develop is temporary – when conditions inevitably change, we will have to adjust.”

<a id="What-Exactly-has-Changed"></a>
### What, Exactly, has Changed ?

“In the middle of the 1800s, that began to change,”
“New machines made it possible to produce things people needed or wanted”
“Companies formed around these new technologies and began to draw people into cities for work to create these new goods. This “industrial revolution”
“But as with most big transitions, there was a trade‐off. These new jobs didn't come with the same freedom to organize one's own days, weeks, and months.”
“There was a supervisor to answer to. And soon, those supervisors were listening to a new kind of expert, a “management consultant” who talked about “efficiencies” and timed each part of a job, finding ways to shave off even hundredths of a second from each component of a task, in order to maximize profits.”
“Each worker had a supervisor, who was also overseen by a supervisor, and there was another supervisor after that. This structure – the hierarchy – came to characterize the world of work”
“organization charts.”

**What Is a Network?**

![Network](./img/network.png?raw=true "Network Structure")
- It forms around a set of assets, or resources. These assets might take many forms: a physical location, a particular technology, even an intangible set of ideas that people hold in common. We often call this set of assets the hub of the network.
- There is usually a set of people who are particularly closely related to the hub. They may be the people who formed the initial network. Communication is easiest within this core, particularly if they are geographically in the same location.
- There are other people who are more loosely connected. They may not even be connected to the hub directly, but rather connected through someone else. It's challenging to get a message to all of these people, particularly those on the periphery.
- The network is never static. There may be people who start off in the core but then become less connected, while there may be other people who become more deeply involved over time. The boundary dividing who is “in” and who is “out” of the network is a porous one.
- There is no “top” or “bottom” to a network. There is no one individual or entity that can give directions for the members to carry out.

**Kinds of Networks**

- advocacy networks  
*made up of people who work to advance a particular cause or idea. Members don't necessarily know each other, but all are part of the network because of its mission.*
- Learning networks  
*group of people wants to increase their knowledge or skills in a particular area. At least some of the members usually know one another reasonably well.*
- innovating network  
*networks are composed of people who have joined forces to create new value together, like the children's story Stone Soup*

**Hierarchies, Networks, and Strategy**
In a hierarchy, the challenge is to communicate information about what to do down, and to get information about the results up.  
In a network, on the other hand, the challenge is to get the members' resources and efforts aligned toward a chosen objective.

### S-Curve

![s-curve](./img/s-curve.png?raw=true "The S-Curve")

S‐Curves help us understand what is happening at various points in the cycle – or, to put it more broadly, in any change process.
There are three important insights S‐Curves provide:
- Change is constant and dynamic.
- Nothing lasts forever under its initial momentum.
- Success contains the seeds of its own destruction.

<a id="The-Changes-We-Need-To-Make"></a>
### The Changes We Need To Make

- We need to think differently.
- We need to behave differently.
- We need to “do” differently (this is different than behaving differently).

**Thinking Differently**  
Let's start with a not‐so‐simple question: What is strategy, anyhow?  
Where are we going? and How are we going to get there? With this definition, think about the strategic plans you've recently read or been a part of developing.  
Strategy has to be a team effort, and the more complex the environment, the larger the group – the network – that will need to be engaged.  
The word we often use for working together is *collaboration*.  
Collaboration involves linking, leveraging, and aligning resources in ways that enhance one another's capacity to create a shared outcome, a mutual benefit.
